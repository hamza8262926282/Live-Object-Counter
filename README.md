# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection and Counting Using YOLOv8 + OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time object detection and counting using the YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. It captures live video from your webcam and detects specific objects such as persons, cars, bikes, dogs, bottles, etc., and counts them when they cross a virtual line on screen.
